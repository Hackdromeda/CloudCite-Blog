# About CloudCite
The Hackdromeda Team is excited to share our progress on [CloudCite](https://cloudcite.net), a new open source bibliography generator. Our motives for developing this free service were simple. We wanted a distraction free bibliography generator that has no obtrusive advertisements, disable ad-blocking messages, survey popups, or similar hindrances to a productive environment. Our frustrations with the popular bibliography generator services were transformed into an intense period of development. We wanted to create something that would not be a small project but instead a high quality service that would be dependable, consistent, and reliable. We also wanted to make it easy for anyone to contribute to our projects so we wrote [API documentation](https://api.cloudcite.net/) to simplify the development process. The [CloudCite repository](https://github.com/Hackdromeda/cloudcite/) is 100% open source under the [AGPLv3 license](https://github.com/Hackdromeda/cloudcite/blob/master/LICENSE).

## Features

### Citations

CloudCite can generate citations for websites, books, and films. The process for generating citations is as simple as three steps.

1. Select a format (Website, Book, or Film)
2. Enter the title
3. Edit Citation

CloudCite supports manual citations that do not use the advanced autofill features. Creating manual citations is also a simple process.

1. Select a format (Website, Book, or Film)
2. Click on Manual Citation
3. Edit Citation

### Previews

As the fields on the editing form are changed, the preview of the citation will be updated. This feature makes it easier to understand the different components of a citation. Previews can be copied with formatting by selecting the clipboard export option.

### Bibliographies

Citations saved in the editing form are added to the bibliography, which is formatted based on the selected citation style and locale. The entire bibliography can be copied with formatting by selecting the clipboard export option. Citations can be edited again by selecting the pencil.

### Citation Styles

CloudCite supports many different citation styles and makes it easy to add or remove favorite styles. The bibliography is updated when the style is changed.

## Release Notes

CloudCite Alpha is an early release and there are no guarantees about the accuracy of citations, bibliographies, or other features including those that are described above and those that are not.
